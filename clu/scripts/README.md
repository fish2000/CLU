N.B. regarding “clu/scripts/boilerplate.py”
===========================================

If the contents of this file appear skeletal and unfinished, it’s exactly because they are, intentionally. “boilerplate.py”
is the untouched, uncensored, and utterly unmitigated output of the invocation of the “clu-boilerplate” CLI endpoint, which
one of the unit tests in “test_boilerplate.py” imports and executes wholesale, as proof-positive of this code fragments’ 
ineffable shipability. Maybe it should be elsewhere? Maybe not – I’ll shed that bike when I cross in front of it while texting,
dogg, yeah.
