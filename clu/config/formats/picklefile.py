        This class uses two mixins: both “clu.config.base.AppName” and
        “clu.config.filebase.FileName” are part of its inheritance chain.
        The “AppName” mixin acts on the “appname” class keyword, and the
        “FileName” mixin acts on the “filename” class keyword (furnishing
        many related class methods).

        This class is specifically germane to the CLU project – note
        that the “appname” and “filename” class keywords are used to
        assign values that are CLU-specific.
        
        CLU users who wish to use pickle files as NamespacedMutableMappings
        in their own projects should create a subclass of PickleFileBase of
        their own. Like this one, it needs to assign both the “appname”
        and the “filename” class keywords; it is unnecessary (but OK!) to
        define further methods, properties, class constants, and whatnot.
