Ihr naht euch wieder, schwankende Gestalten; Die früh sich einst dem trüben
Blick gezeigt; Versuch’ ich wohl euch diesmal fest zu halten? Fühl’ ich mein

Wie ihr aus Dunst und Nebel um mich steigt. Mein Busen fühlt sich jugendlich
erschüttert! Vom Zauberhauch der euren Zug umwittert. Ihr bringt mit euch die
Bilder froher Tage? Und manche liebe Schatten steigen auf Gleich einer alten,
halbverklungnen Sage? Kommt erste Lieb’ und Freundschaft mit herauf Der Schmerz

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the
essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and
not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived? I did not wish to live
what was not life, living is so dear; Nor did I wish to practise resignation,
unless it was quite necessary; I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow
of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan like as to put to rout all that was not
life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and
reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the
whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world? Or if
it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of
it in my next excursion; For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange
uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat
hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify God and enjoy
him forever. Still we live meanly, like ants; Though the fable tells us that we
were long ago changed into men! Like pygmies we fight with cranes? It is error
upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a
superfluous and evitable wretchedness! Our life is frittered away by detail; An
honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme
cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest! Simplicity, simplicity,
simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a
thousand! Instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on
your thumbnail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are
the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand and one items to be allowed
for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and
not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator
indeed who succeeds! Simplify, simplify! Instead of three meals a day, if it be
necessary eat but one! Instead of a hundred dishes, five! And reduce other
things in proportion! I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary. Over many a
quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore. While I nodded, nearly napping,
suddenly there came a tapping; As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
chamber door; 'Tis some visiter, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door! Only
this, and nothing more. Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor? Eagerly I wished
the morrow? —vainly I had sought to borrow. From my books surcease of
sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore? For the rare and radiant maiden whom the
angels name Lenore. Nameless here for evermore; And the silken sad uncertain
rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors
never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood
repeating Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door! Some late
visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door? This it is, and nothing more?
Presently my soul grew stronger? Hesitating then no longer! Sir, said I, or
Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so
gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber
door! That I scarce was sure I heard you, here I opened wide the door; Darkness
there, and nothing more? Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there
wondering, fearing! Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream
before; But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token? And the
only word there spoken was the whispered word, Lenore. This I whispered, and an
echo murmured back the word, Lenore! Merely this, and nothing more. Once upon a
